### Usage
---

####  Download repository

1- In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this.

>>> In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python `-m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 `-m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.

2- With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
